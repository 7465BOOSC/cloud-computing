## About the Course
Cloud computing systems today, whether open-source or used inside companies, are built using a common set of core techniques, algorithms, and design philosophies—all centered around distributed systems. Learn about such fundamental distributed computing "concepts" for cloud computing.

Some of these concepts include:
 - Clouds, MapReduce, key-value stores
 - Classical precursors
 - Widely-used algorithms
 - Classical algorithms
 - Scalability
 - Trending areas
 - And more!

Understand how these techniques work inside today’s most widely-used cloud computing systems. Get your hands dirty using these concepts with provided homework exercises. In the optional programming track, implement some of these concepts in template assignments provided in C++ programming language.
